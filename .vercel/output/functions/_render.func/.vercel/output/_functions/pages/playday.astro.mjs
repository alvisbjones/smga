const html = "<h2 id=\"when-we-play\">When we play</h2>\n<h4 id=\"weekly-games\">Weekly games:</h4>\n<p>We have a standing tee time of 9AM on Monday’s and Fridays.  Depending on the number of players for a given playday,we will shotgun start teams starting on 17, 18, and number one.  We focus on keeping all rounds under 4 hours by using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>net double bogie maximum rule of the world handicap system</li>\n<li>local rule for out of bounds &#x26; lost ball (alternative to stroke &#x26; distance - two stroke penalty take to fairway)</li>\n<li>friendly encouragement on best cart practices for pace of play</li>\n<li>regular communication on pace of play</li>\n<li>“Balance of handicaps” in a group.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"tournaments\">Tournaments:</h4>\n<p>We schedule 4 tournaments each season that are also played on either a Monday or Friday.  The schedule is published in the spring at the start of each golf season.  These tournaments are a mix of individual and two person team events.<br>\nSee <a href=\"/schedule\">Tournament Schedule</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"signing-up-for-playday-and-playday-routine\">Signing up for playday and playday routine</h2>\n<p>The signup process differs slightly between Monday and Friday.</p>\n<h3 id=\"monday\">Monday:</h3>\n<p>Please signup by no later than Sunday 5pm using the Invited Club app or website.  Search for the SMGA events under the “events tab” in the tee time section.  Select the event and add your name to the list of players that are planning to play.  You can manage any changes to your participation up until 5pm on Sunday.  Please help us to minimize late changes as it causes a ripple effect on Monday morning if you do not show up and teams are already established.</p>\n<h3 id=\"friday\">Friday:</h3>\n<p>On Fridays we use golf genius and the game is planned by the staff in the pro shop.  You will get a email several days in advance of the Friday event inviting you to participate.  Please make sure your email is included in the SMGA golf genius list (see pro shop to verify).  You must click the link in the email by 7pm on Thursday indicating your participation in the event, and you will receive a email notification confirming your intention to play.  Make sure you email filters (spam, whitelist, etc.) are set such that you recieve the email.</p>\n<h4 id=\"both-days\">Both days:</h4>\n<p>Please arrive at the club no later than 30 minutes before our start time to check-in and put your prize pool money in the envelopes in the pro shop.  The pairings for that day will be available in the pro shop so you will know who you need to group with for that event.</p>\n<h4 id=\"after-social-and-prize-payout\">After social and prize payout:</h4>\n<p>After the round, we gather in the club house to review the outcome and payout any prizes for that day’s event.  All in good fun, joking and ribbing take place as we recall the good and bad of the day’s event.  This gives us all the opportunity to visit and laugh with the rest of the group that are present for that day.  Our focus is on friendly competition with a community of guys with a love of the game.</p>\n<h2 id=\"basic-format-of-playdays\">Basic format of playdays</h2>\n<p>In the spirit of friendly competition, we collect a players pool each playday ($5) and a closest to the pin pool ($1) that is payed out each playday to the winners (team/teams or individual/individuals) depending on the format for that playday.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mondays-signup-for-the-event-on-invited-club-website--app\">Monday’s (signup for the event on Invited Club website / app)</h4>\n<p>On Monday’s a member of the SMGA “manager of the day” will arrange the teams and the game.  This could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>individual events (low net, quota)</li>\n<li>Team events (2,3 &#x26; 4 man formats depending on number signed up with “balanced handicap” teams)</li>\n<li>Occasionally just play no competitiion (green aeration, odd circumstances)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each golfer responsible for entering their score into the GHIN system</p>\n<h4 id=\"fridays-signup-by-responding-to-golf-genius-email-invite\">Friday’s (signup by responding to golf genius email invite)</h4>\n<p>On Friday’s we normally use golf genius based games setup by the proshop.  This could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quota based games</li>\n<li>4 man Team formats (2 best net, Cha,Cha,Cha , Lone Ranger)</li>\n<li>3 man Team formats (Scramble, low net, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using golf genius, teams are balanced based on handicaps and scores are entered into the app during play with real time scoring, leaderboard, and final results available within the app.  Golf genius will also automatically post individual scores to the GHIN handicap system.</p>";
