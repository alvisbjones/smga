## When we play
#### Weekly games:
We have a standing tee time of 9AM on Monday's and Fridays.  Depending on the number of players for a given playday, we will shotgun start teams starting on holes 17, 18, and number one.  
We focus on Pace of Play keeping all rounds under 4 hours. 


## Basic format of playdays
In the spirit of friendly competition, we collect a players pool each playday ($5) and a closest to the pin pool that is paidd out each playday to the winners (team/teams or individual/individuals) depending on the format for that playday.

## Signing up for playday and playday routine
The signup process differs slightly between Monday and Friday.  
### Monday:
Please signup by no later than Sunday 5pm using the Invited Club app or [website](https://www.invitedclubs.com).  Our playdays are listed as "Seniors @THE HILLS COURSE" under the "My events tab" in the tee time section.    Select the event and add your name to the list of players that are planning to play.  You can manage any changes to your participation up until 5pm on Sunday.  

Please help us to minimize late changes as it causes a ripple effect on Monday morning if you do not show up and teams are already established. 
On Mondayâ€™s the game day manager will arrange the teams and the game.   <a href="games" class="button">Games we play</a>

Each golfer is responsible for entering their score into the GHIN system.


### Friday:
On Fridays we use golf genius and the game is planned by the staff in the pro shop.

You must click the link in the email by 7pm on Thursday indicating your participation in the event.  You will receive a email notification confirming your intention to play.

Your scores are entered into the Golf Genius app during play.  This enables real time scoring, leaderboard, and final results.  Golf genius will also automatically post individual scores to the GHIN handicap system.  

#### Both days:
Please arrive at the club no later than 30 minutes before our start time to check-in and put your prize pool money in the envelopes in the pro shop.  The pairings, scorecards, and tee assignments for that day will be in the pro shop.

## After social and prize payout:
After the round, we gather in the club house to review the results and payout any prizes for that day's event.  

Fun and comradary takes place as we recall the good and bad of the day's event.  This gives us all the opportunity to visit and laugh with the rest of the group that are present for that day.  Our focus is on friendly competition with a community of guys with a love of the game.
